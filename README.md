# Tag Hunter (v1)

## What is Tag Hunter?

Tag Hunter is a GeoGuessr-type game where users are tasked with locating street art around Wellington, New Zealand. 

It can be played without an account, however signing in to the application provides some additional features such as:

- Access to your Profile page which shows your gameplay statistics, as well as any art you have successfully found so far
- Unlock the Gallery, where you can view all artworks currently in our database
- Check out the Leaderboard and see how you fare against other people

Have a look at the deployed app [here](hunter-mako-kotare-2024.pushed.nz)

## Who created it?

This full-stack web application was created across one week as a final group project at Dev Academy in 2024.

All collaborators and links to their personal Github accounts can be found on the Tag Hunter repo home page.


## Some of the technology used:

- React
- JavaScript + TypeScript
- Node.js
- SQLite3
- Google Maps API
- Tailwind CSS
- Supertest


## What does the future hold for Tag Hunter?

There are a plethora of features we aimed to include in the application but simply ran out of time to do. As such, a few collaborators who worked on this project intend to continue with development to add some of those features in. These features include:

- Users can submit their own art
- Expanding gameplay to beyond Wellington, New Zealand (maybe even globally one day!)
- Rate artworks
- Plus much, much more :)
